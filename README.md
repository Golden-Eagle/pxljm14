PLXJM 2014 Entree


getting the code and building:

```
git clone https://github.com/Golden-Eagle/pxljm14.git pxljm14
cd pxljm14
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
```

then, on Windows, just open the solution, set the working directory to pxljm14, and build!

on linux, you need to build then move to pxljm14 before running

```
make
cd ..
./build/bin/platform
```

Instructions will surely change as names change in project.
