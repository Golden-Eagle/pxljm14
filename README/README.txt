This year, as with the previous, we brainstormed an adventure of a larger scale than what is possible to make in 48 hours, and attempted to reach a first iteration of the game, to extend upon later. 

Please see the concept image for an idea of our direction. Each emotion has a balanced relationship with the others, and associated strengths and weaknesses, the player will have to figure out how to manipulate and combine them to pass certain challenges. The environment will change depending on the players current state, etc.

A large part of the interest for us is developing a solution that serves the game well. So rather than use an existing game engine, we used a combination of Box2D, C++, Spine2D, OpenGl 3, with an engine we began working on two weeks prior.



INTENDED PLOT
Various Antagonists are threatening destroying a number of anchors keeping the world from being torn apart. 
Some anchors are large machines while some are less obvious, (living creatures etc). 
The land is glitching out, crevices are opening to let enemies in, and the land is becoming dangerous. 
The protagonists goal is to restore the land by mastering her own balance of emotional powers.  



INSTRUCTIONS
For now the goal is to stay alive - avoiding and killing enemies, and avoiding dangerous falls.
